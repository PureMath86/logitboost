Installation
============

The latest version of LogitBoost can be installed directly after cloning from
`GitHub <https://github.com/artemmavrin/logitboost>`__.

.. code-block :: shell

  git clone https://github.com/artemmavrin/logitboost.git
  cd survive
  make install

Moreover, LogitBoost is on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/logitboost/>`__, so a
recent version of it can be installed with the
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ tool.

.. code-block :: shell

  python -m pip install logitboost

Make sure your Python version is at least 3.6 (LogitBoost was developed using
Python 3.7).
